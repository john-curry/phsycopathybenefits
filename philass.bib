Abstract = {In this primarily descriptive study, the authors describe a sample of patients referred or brought to a Brazilian civil psychiatric facility for evaluation and consultation because of a chronic pattern of social and behavioral problems. Their Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL: SV) scores generally were very high, and half of the patients met the DSM-IV criteria for antisocial personality disorder. In addition, about half of the patients reportedly had been charged or convicted of a serious criminal offense. The correlates of the PCL: SV were consistent with the research literature on psychopathy in criminal and forensic psychiatric populations. The results add to the small but growing literature on psychopathy in the community and are consistent with the view that antisocial dispositions and behaviors are part of the psychopathy construct.

Abstract = {The manuscript surveys the history of psychopathic personality, from its origins in psychiatric folklore to its modern assessment in the forensic arena. Individuals with psychopathic personality, or psychopaths, have a disproportionate impact on the criminal justice system. Psychopaths are twenty to twenty-five times more likely than non-psychopaths to be in prison, four to eight times more likely to violently recidivate compared to non-psychopaths, and are resistant to most forms of treatment. This article presents the most current clinical efforts and neuroscience research in the field of psychopathy. Given psychopathy's enormous impact on society in general and on the criminal justice system in particular, there are significant benefits to increasing awareness of the condition. This review also highlights a recent, compelling and cost-effective treatment program that has shown a significant reduction in violent recidivism in youth on a putative trajectory to psychopathic personalit},

Abstract = {This short theoretical paper elucidates a plausible theory about the Global Financial Crisis and the role of senior financial corporate directors in that crisis. The paper presents a theory of the Global Financial Crisis which argues that psychopaths working in corporations and in financial corporations, in particular, have had a major part in causing the crisis. This paper is thus a very short theoretical paper but is one that may be very important to the future of capitalism because it discusses significant ways in which Corporate Psychopaths may have acted recently, to the detriment of many. Further research into this theory is called for. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {This article explains who Corporate Psychopaths are, and some of the processes by which they stimulate counterproductive work behaviour among employees. The article hypothesizes that conflict and bullying will be higher, that employee affective well-being will be lower and that frequencies of counterproductive work behaviour will also be higher in the presence of Corporate Psychopaths. Research was conducted among 304 respondents in Britain in 2011, using a psychopathy scale embedded in a self-completion management survey. The article concludes that Corporate Psychopaths have large and significant impacts on conflict and bullying and employee affective well-being; these have large and significant impacts on counterproductive work behaviour. There is no difference between male and female degrees of negative reaction to the presence of managers who are Corporate Psychopaths. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{ruthlesspsych,
Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of Corporate Psychopaths as ruthless employees who can successfully gain entry to organizations and can then get promoted within those organizations to reach senior managerial and leadership positions. What little empirical research currently exists supports the view that Corporate Psychopaths are more commonly found at senior levels of organizations. This paper presents further empirical evidence that supports this view. It discusses how, in a quantitative sample of 346 white-collar workers, in 2008, research using a psychopathy scale identified greater levels of psychopathy at more senior levels of corporations than at more junior levels. The paper goes on to propose that this is a universal issue that can pose various ethical problems for corporations because of the ruthless, selfish and conscience-free approach to life that Corporate Psychopaths have. Other ethical issues are to do with their moral accountability and with the problems associated w},

Abstract = {Psychopathy has long been identified as a central personality correlate of criminal and violent behaviour yet remains relatively unexplored in Australia. The present study utilised the recently developed Self-Report Psychopathy Scale – III (SRP-III) with an Australian community sample (N = 327). As expected, males reported higher levels of psychopathy across the four SRP-III facets, callous-affect (CA), interpersonally manipulative (IPM), erratic life-style (ELS) and criminal tendencies (CT). Psychopathy was associated with lower levels of empathy (especially CA), higher alcohol use (ELS, CT), pro-violence thoughts (IPM, CA) and elevated depression, anxiety and stress (IPM, ELS). Each facet was found to enhance the statistical prediction of physical aggression, beyond age, gender, social desirability and violent thoughts. The SRP-III is a potentially useful instrument for measuring psychopathic characteristics when comprehensive documentation is not available. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER},

Abstract = {This meta-analysis investigated the relationship between measures of brain imaging and psychopathy. The study population included a total of 58 studies in which measures of aMRI, fMRI, SPECT, and PET from patients with diagnosed psychopathy were compared to those obtained from control populations. The typical hypothesis in these studies was that those patients with psychopathy would show deficiencies in neural activity and brain matter in the prefrontal cortex relative to controls. The meta-analysis results indicated an overall significant effect size across studies of approximately 20%. The effect size was consistent across 56 of the 58 studies. Two studies showed an effect that was not in the predicted direction. Effect size was also related to the type of brain imaging. Those studies that used fMRI and MRI techniques produced generally smaller effect sizes relative to those that used aMRI, PET or SPECT techniques. The effect sizes in these studies were unrelated to other variables},

Abstract = {The Axis II Work Group of the Task Force on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) has expressed concern that antisocial personality disorder (APD) criteria are too long and cumbersome and that they focus on antisocial behaviors rather than personality traits central to traditional conceptions of psychopathy and to international criteria.

The authors also discuss the multisite APD field trials designed to evaluate and compare 4 criteria sets: the DSM-III—R criteria, a shortened list of these criteria, the criteria for dyssocial personality disorder from the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization, 1990), and a 10-item criteria set for psychopathic personality disorder derived from the revised Psychopathy Checklist.
